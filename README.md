# Foerm

## About

Unlike other libraries, `Foerm` has been built from the ground up with a `field-first` approach to validation.

What does this mean?

- Validation can easily be added and removed to a form
- No need for a large set of upfront domain knowledge

## Usage

## Valdiation

Validation can occur

-
- onChange - after a field's value has changed
- onBlur - after a field has been blurred
- onGlobalChange - after the form has been changed
